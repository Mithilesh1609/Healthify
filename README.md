# Healthify
This was our database management system theory and lab project. Used oracle 11g for creating databases and used Django to content it with the frontend and used Bootstrap to make our front end. The project goal was to develop a food ordering platform that helps you to know about users' food nutrition they get per dish. DBMS facilitates users with creating accounts, ordering food, tracking history, and checking nutrition in their order.
